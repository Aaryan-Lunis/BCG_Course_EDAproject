# BCG_Course_EDAproject
This project is a BCG x Forage job simulation where I analyzed financial data from 10-K reports of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple using Python and Pandas. I then built a simple AI-powered financial chatbot using Streamlit that answers predefined queries about revenue, net income, and other key metrics.
